[b]Community Promotion Screen[/b] is an expanded and improved version of the [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1124609091]New Promotion Screen By Default[/url][/b]. 

It replaces the standard soldier promotion screen with a modified version of the "Faction Hero" promotion screen that was added in War of the Chosen.

[h1]FEATURES[/h1]
[list]
[*] [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=667104300][WotC] Mod Config Menu[/url][/b] support.
[*] Improved controller support.
[*] All-new ability tagging system to assist in planning soldier's ability unlocks. Disabled by default, needs to be enabled in Mod Config Menu.
[*] Improved support for other mods, including Highlander.
[*] Custom ability point cost can now be configured for all soldier classes at the same time. Class-specific cost still takes priority.
[*] Added localization for SPARK ability row titles in all languages; this will not interfere with mods adding their own localization for them.
[*] "More info" yellow question mark icon will be shown for [i]all[/i] revealed abilities, not just the ones on soldier's the current rank or lower.
[*] Support mutually exclusive abilities setup on ability templates.

[list]
[*] Scrollbar no longer gets misplaced when in windowed mode.

[/list]

[h1]COMPATIBILITY[/h1]
[list]
[*] All mods that require [b]New Promotion Screen By Default[/b] can be used with the [b]Community Promotion Screen[/b] instead.
[*] Community Promotion Screen can be used together with [b]New Promotion Screen By Default[/b], but then the [b]New Promotion Screen By Default[/b] will be simply quietly disabled and will not do anything. You will also see a warning popup saying that.
[*] Community Promotion Screen is [b][i]incompatible[/i][/b] with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1280477867][b]Musashis RPG Overhaul[/b][/url], as it adds its own promotion screen.
